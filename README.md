This is an AngularJS capstone project I built at the end of the Thinkful AngularJS course. Includes Karma tests, including a test during the Gulp build to makes sure unit tests pass before deployment to Github ghpages.

All data is from Sunlight Foundation API. I did create a PHP service on my server (stuartdotson.com) to aggregate the candidate results in a more sensible format. By default, their API returns presidential candidates 100 at a time in no particular order and with no API parameters to put them in a sensible order. (Little known fact: There are over 500 candidates that have filed to run for president of the United States).
